## GrassRoots Volunteer Frontend
Welcome, if you are seeing this you have most likely volunteered with us in the GrassRoots Select team. This repo is for the development of the front end of our volunteer project.
If you have any feedback feel free to leave it in the devVolunteer-DB slack channel. 


## Getting Started

So whether you are brand new or somewhat familiar with this project I'll start by detailing the file structure as well as the frameworks this project is currently using. 

The basic mockup is a navigation page that is our `index.html` this houses the nav bar, as well as a footer that follows the user throughout the entire site.
Next you will find the partials any page that has partial prepended is a view that will be placed within the index page I.E. `partial-index.html`. 

Folders should be used as such. 
- css : any and all styles should be placed here.
- js: all scripts will be here
- partials: Any view that is not a shared view should go here.
- resources: If it doesn't fit either of the other folders mentioned above it probably goes here.


Frameworks and resources
- Angular Js
- Angular Ui Router
- Semantic Ui
- JQuery
- FontAwesome

Always willing to try new things, but remember we are wanting to keep this project easily maintainable and approachable. So don't get too crazy with including different components in the project.
